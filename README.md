Health Status Statement:


Since all applications involve this wide range disability questionnaire, let me please state the
following:
I thank GOD every second that I do not have any disability, and pray GOD to stay so till I die.
-I only suffer normal aging symptoms since I'm 51+ now, so I use 2 glasses far (usual activities)
& near (reading). Also, my knee hurts sometimes that I avoid taking the stairs as much as
possible, and I pray while I'm sitting or standing if not possible (as a Moslem my prayers contain
going down then up few times but I pray while I'm sitting). However, I make it as a habit that I walk a nearly 3Km distance back & forth everyday (or couple of days at maximum)
-I never drink Alcohol (or anything that makes the mind go away), and I never eat Ham.

The thing is universities put really a wide range that they sometimes include diabetics or high blood pressure; I do not want to use the equity-diversity idea behind that, still I do mot want to pretend to be Ms "all perfect"
